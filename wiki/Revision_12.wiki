*Revision 12*

Revision 12 contained some very minor changes to bring the project to its final submission. It contains 2 display changes and an essential bug fix
  
----
* 1. Display Improvements	

To improve performance in the Task page I replaced  the indent left and right images with '<<<' and '>>>'. In the Chart page to improve the readability of the predecessor lines I added line branches to clearly show what task was connected to which predecessor line.
----
* 2. Defect Fix	

A minor bug occured in the task page when the last task contained a predecessor value which caused the application to fall over.
