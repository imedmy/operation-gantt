*Revision 11*

For Revision 11 the main tasks achieved were:
 # Create a new method in the DatabaseManager Model called AssignPredecessor.
 # Add predecessor field to all areas of the TaskController/Task Page
 # Update Database to include Predecessor field
 # Update ChartBuilder to create Predecessor lines

If this is the case then that current task must start on or after the end date of the predecessor task. If it does not the method will change the current task start date to equal the predecessor end date and also change the current task end date while keeping the current task duration the same as before.

* 2. Predecessor field

A Predecessor field was added throughout the TaskController/Task Page to allow the user to input a Predecessor relationship between tasks. Currently the application allows one Predecessor value to be entered which must be also be a previous row id.

A new field was added to Azure Database called
