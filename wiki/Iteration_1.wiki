*Iteration 1*

For the first iteration the intention as stated in the Analysis  Document was to implement the following:
  # User Story 5: Add New Task
  # User Story 6: Edit Existing Task

Both User Stories were successfully implemented within the context of Entity Framework. This was achieved by the following:
 * A Windows Azure Database called project was created
 * One table called Task was created with 4 fields:
   # Row_ID
   # Task_Name
   # Start_Time
   # End_Time
A new web page called Task was created that used CRUD and Entity Framework to manage all tasks within Azure Database.

An additional web page was then created called MyChart with the intention of displaying all previous tasks in a Gantt chart. This will now be completed in Iteration 2. However Iteration 1 did successfully display a Gantt Chart from hard coded data using in built charting controls within the .Net Framework.

Unit testing of the Task webpage and the CRUD was successfully achieved.
