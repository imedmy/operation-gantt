*Iteration 1*

 * For the first iteration the intention as stated in the Analysis  Document was to implement the following:
  # User Story 5: Add New Task
  # User Story 6: Edit Existing Task

 * Both User Stories were successfully implemented within the Entity Framework. This was achieved by the following:
 
 * MVC3 Project was re-created for new table
 * CRUD was successfully implemented for this table
 * Application is now run locally but database is still on Azure
