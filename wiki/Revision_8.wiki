*Revision 8*

For Revision 8 the main task achieved was to extract the minimum start time and maximum end time from all subtasks and insert them into the corresponding summary tasks. 
  
----
1. Assign Summary Task Dates
  *	This had to work for multiple subtask layers. Currently the code allows for infinite subtask layers. This code was placed in a new static method called AssignSummaryDates within the DatabaseManager.cs model file. Currently it is only implemented upon insertion of a new task at the end of the list (“Create New”). However it will also be implemented into the “Insert” and “Delete” options in the next revision.

2. Minor Alterations
  *     The x axis labels were changed to better display each monthly breakdown of tasks using a custom label.
