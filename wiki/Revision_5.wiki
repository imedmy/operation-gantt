*Revision 5*

For Revision 5 the two main tasks achieved were
  # Clean up previous source code to date
  # Set up a Database Manager Model

----
Clean up previous source code:
 * 1.	Project was reconstructed from beginning. The Ado.Net Entity
Data Model replaced the NuGet 3rd party software previously used.
This made the code cleaner and smaller. 

 * 2.   Reconstructed JQuery datepicker. Previously had two methods
combined and only 1 worked. Rebuilt just 1 method so code is now
cleaner and smaller.	
----
Set up a Database Manager Model:
 * The new model contained 3 essential methods:
   # RowNoRetrieval
   # RowSortAfterDelete
   # RowSortPreInsert

 * 1. RowNoRetrieval is called when creating a new task. A query is sent to the database to find the last row id and the new task is then given a new row id which will become the new final task
 * 2. RowSortPreInsert is called if a user wants to put a new task in a row id other than the last row. This method is called when "Insert" is selected
One outstanding issue in this area (to be implemented in Iteration 2) is to automatically increment the Row_ID as each task is added (or decremented on delete). Currently it allows the Row_ID to be manually inserted.
